A few exciting updates to share with you, let's break it down.

### New landscape player mode

A first step has been made to allow the Code&Robots app to be used in landscape mode to let the user control the robot with both hands, which feels quite nice. The next step is to build a MVP with a second joystick to control another part of a robot, e.g move and tilt on a drone!

The Beta version 1.0.13 of the Android app has been released to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeandrobots.beta&ah=fmxnGH-WXpRTFOPNCggRzlARIIk) and version 1.0.9 of the iOS app has been released to the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/code-robots/id1462402633?mt=8).

With the help of [@cparrapa](https://github.com/cparrapa) (OttoDIY founder), the OttoDIY app is now available to download on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otto-diy/id1495304583?ls=1&fbclid=IwAR0l4b-3Jhlfh-e-ZI5sKt8DHFl9NV0Qg95giCb0m9x1AJ3L5reBYOVHAXk).

Both the [Android OttoDIY app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ottodiy) and [iOS OttoDIY app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otto-diy/id1495304583?ls=1&fbclid=IwAR0l4b-3Jhlfh-e-ZI5sKt8DHFl9NV0Qg95giCb0m9x1AJ3L5reBYOVHAXk) now also include the code lab feature.
