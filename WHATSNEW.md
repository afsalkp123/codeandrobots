## February 3, 2019

The initial code base for the React Native mobile app is now on [Github](https://github.com/codeandrobots/codeandrobots-app).

The Beta version of the app is live on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeandrobots.beta&ah=fmxnGH-WXpRTFOPNCggRzlARIIk). The app doesn't do too much right now but it's a good start, new screens and functionality will be added over the coming weeks.

If you have questions or there's anything else we can help you with, please do [get in touch](mailto:codeandrobotshq@gmail.com).
